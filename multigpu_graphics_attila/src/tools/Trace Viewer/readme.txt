        Qt Application "Test"
========================================================================


This Developer Studio Project file has been created by the QMsDev
plugin and is a basic implementation of a Qt application based on
a Basic interface.

The project contains the following files in which you should add the
code for your project:

main.cpp
	The starting point for your application. Add startup routines, e.g.
	commandline processing here.

testwindow.h
	A basic declaration of your application window. Add declarations of
	methods here.
testwindow.cpp
	A basic implementation of the methods declared in
	testwindow.h. Add implementation code here.

The following files will be generated during the Qt specific build
steps, and you shouldn't modify them:

moc_testwindow.cpp
